# Toggle

## Usage

```html
<a-toggle v-model="yourValue" labelId="example-id" />
```

<ArgTypes of={ToggleStories} />

`AToggle` renders an HTML button element with an `aria-pressed` attribute, which makes it
a [toggle button](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/button_role#toggle_buttons).

<Canvas of={ToggleStories.On} />

The [aria-pressed](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-pressed#mixed)
attribute for toggle buttons also supports a value of `mixed`.

> A value of mixed means that the values of more than one item controlled by the button do not all share the same value.

<Canvas of={ToggleStories.Mixed} />

### Using with v-model (recommended)

This component is designed as a **controlled** component, meaning that it does not update its own state,
but relies on the value provided by `v-model` instead. The `v-model` value is automatically updated on click events
(including those triggered by `space` and `enter` keys).
See [Vue docs on v-model](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/events.html#usage-with-v-model).

### Using with event listener

For more granular control over model value state changes,
use the `modelValue` prop and the `update:modelValue` event.

```html
<!-- in your template -->
<a-toggle :model-value="toggleState" @update:model-value="handleChange" labelId="example-id" />
```

```js
// in your component's setup
const toggleState = ref(true)
const handleChange = newValue => {
  toggleState.value = newValue
}
```

## Disabling the toggle

To disable the toggle, just add a `disabled` attribute.

<Canvas of={ToggleStories.OnDisabled} />
<Canvas of={ToggleStories.OffDisabled} />
<Canvas of={ToggleStories.MixedDisabled} />

## Labelling the toggle

`<a-toggle>` can be used inside the `<a-input-group>` component to create consistently styled
labelled inputs. For more details, follow the [InputGroup documentation](path=/docs/components-inputgroup--label).

However, a toggle switch component can be used in a variety of UIs, with variously designed labels.
Please make sure to provide your text label element with a unique `id` and pass it as the `labelId` prop to `<a-toggle>`.

<Canvas of={ToggleStories.WithLabel} />

If appropriate, add a click event listener to the labelling element to update to toggle state as well.

<Canvas of={ToggleStories.WithClickableLabel} />

### Screen reader only label

In some case the toggle may not have a visible labelling element (e.g. in a table layout).
In that case it is advised to provide an invisible labelling element with a tailwind class `sr-only`:

```html
<div>
  <!-- this label will not be visible -->
  <p id="my-toggle" class="sr-only">My Toggle</p>
  <a-toggle v-model="toggleState" labelId="my-toggle" />
</div>
```
