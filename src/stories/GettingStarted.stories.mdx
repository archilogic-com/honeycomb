# Getting Started

## Installation

```
npm i @archilogic/honeycomb
```

This library requires several peer dependencies: `tailwindcss`, `vue`, and `@headlessui/vue`.
They will be installed automatically unless there is a version conflict.
Please refer to `package.json` to determine a compatible version.

## Configuring Tailwind CSS

This library relies on Tailwind CSS to work correctly.
As a peer dependency, it will be installed automatically.

### Tailwind config

You need to create a `tailwind.config.js` file with the following content:

```js
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  presets: [require('@archilogic/honeycomb/tailwind/tailwind-preset.cjs')],
  // if you wish to include our global styles, add the base plugin
  plugins: [require('@archilogic/honeycomb/tailwind/base.cjs')]
}
```

If you're relying on other packages with tailwind classes
that need to be scanned by the tailwind engine to be included in the final CSS output
you will need to include custom `content` paths in the tailwind config.
E.g.:

```js
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  content: [
    './src/**/*.{js,ts,vue}',
    './node_modules/@archilogic/honeycomb/**/*.{js,css}',
    './node_modules/@archilogic/app-kit/**/*.{js,css}'
  ],
  presets: [require('@archilogic/honeycomb/tailwind/tailwind-preset.cjs')],
  plugins: [require('@archilogic/honeycomb/tailwind/base.cjs')]
}
```

### PostCSS config

Next, you also need to create a PostCSS config, which Tailwind relies upon to generate stylesheets.

```js
// postcss.config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: {
    tailwindcss: {}
  }
}
```

### Import CSS

Finally, import the generated styles and fonts into your app.

```js
// e.g. in App.vue
import '@archilogic/honeycomb/tailwind'
```

For some components it's required to also import the css bundle (mentioned in the respective component's docs if applicable).
If you're using most components from the library, it's safe to add it next to the tailwind import.

```js
import '@archilogic/honeycomb/css'
```

## Component Registration

Registering all available components globally:

```js
import { registerAllComponents } from '@archilogic/honeycomb'

const app = createApp(MyApp)

registerAllComponents(app)
```

To import and register a subset of components, use one of the following ways.

Import from the main package export:

```js
import { AButton } from '@archilogic/honeycomb'
```

Or import from the dedicated `components` export:

```js
import { AButton } from '@archilogic/honeycomb/components'
// Or import all components:
import * as components from '@archilogic/honeycomb/components'
```

Then register locally:

```js
export default defineComponent({
  name: 'MyComponent',
  components: { AButton }
})
```

Or globally:

```js
const app = createApp(MyApp)
app.component('a-button', AButton))
```

## Composables

The library exports some composable functions as well.
They can be imported in the similar way as components.

Or from the main package export:

```js
import { useMultiSelect } from '@archilogic/honeycomb'
```

Either from the dedicated `composables` export:

```js
import { useMultiSelect } from '@archilogic/honeycomb/composables'

// Or import all composables:
import * as composables from '@archilogic/honeycomb/composables'
```
