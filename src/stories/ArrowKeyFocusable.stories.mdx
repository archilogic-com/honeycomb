# ArrowKeyFocusable

## Usage

```html
<a-arrow-key-focusable>…</a-arrow-key-focusable>
<AArrowKeyFocusable>…</AArrowKeyFocusable>
```

<ArgsTable of={AArrowKeyFocusable} />

This component can be used as a wrapper that adds arrow-key navigation to its children.
This is useful for components that should be just one tab stop in the tabbing sequence (aka composite widgets),
within which the user navigates with arrow keys (plus optionally `Home` and `End`).

**Important**: Each child should to have `tabindex` attribute set to `-1`.

## Rendering a different container element

`<a-arrow-key-focusable>` renders as `<div>` by default, but that can be changed with an `as` prop.
You should provide semantically appropriate tags, e.g. `tbody` for a table content, `ul` for a list, etc.
Regular tailwind classes can then be added to style this wrapper.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="list vertical">
    {() => ({
      components: { AArrowKeyFocusable },
      template: `
        <a-arrow-key-focusable class="focus:focus-shadow" as="ul">
          <li tabindex="-1" class="focus:focus-shadow">1</li>
          <li tabindex="-1" class="focus:focus-shadow">2</li>
          <li tabindex="-1" class="focus:focus-shadow">3</li>
        </a-arrow-key-focusable>
        `
    })}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Horizontal and vertical navigation

By default, the component can be navigated with the `up` and `down` arrow keys (see example above).
If you want a horizontal layout and navigation with the `left` and `right` arrow keys, pass the `direction="horizontal"` prop to the component.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="buttons horizontal">
    {() => ({
      components: { AArrowKeyFocusable, AButton },
      template: `
          <a-arrow-key-focusable class="focus:focus-shadow flex" direction="horizontal">
            <a-button tabindex="-1" class="focus:focus-shadow">1</a-button>
            <a-button tabindex="-1" class="focus:focus-shadow">2</a-button>
            <a-button tabindex="-1" class="focus:focus-shadow">3</a-button>
          </a-arrow-key-focusable>
        `
    })}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Non-focusable children

If the tabindex attribute is not set on a child of the `<a-arrow-key-focusable>` component,
the child element will not receive focus and will be skipped by the keyboard navigation.
A typical use case for this is a separator or a title component.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="unfocusable children">
    {() => ({
      components: { AArrowKeyFocusable, ASeparator, AButton },
      template: `
          <a-arrow-key-focusable class="focus:focus-shadow">
            <h1>Example widget</h1>
            <div tabindex="-1" class="focus:focus-shadow bg-athens mb-1">1</div>
            <div tabindex="-1" class="focus:focus-shadow bg-athens mb-1">2</div>
            <a-separator class="my-2"/>
            <div tabindex="-1" class="focus:focus-shadow bg-athens mb-1">3</div>
          </a-arrow-key-focusable>
        `
    })}
  </Story>
</Canvas>
